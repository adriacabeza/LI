% Now you are flying back from China, and you should write such a program to compute how many
% units of each one of six products you should take in your suitcase with capacity 80Kg, if you want
% to maximize the total value, and the products have the following weights (Kg) and values (Euros):
%           p1  p2  p3  p4  p5  p6
%   ------------------------------
%   weight: 1   2   3   5   6   7
%   value:  1   4   7   11  14  15

china:- L = [A,B,C,D,E,F],
L ins 0 .. 80, 1*A + 2*B + 3*C + 5*D + 6*E + 7*F #=< 80,
labeling( [ max( 1*A + 4*B + 7*C + 11*D + 14*E + 15*F ) ], L ), write(L), nl,!.
