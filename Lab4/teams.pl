% A company needs to distribute its employees in working teams of size
% between minSize and maxSize. In order to avoid fights between them,
% the psychology department has computed a score between 0 an 10 for
% each worker, that estimates her leadership skills.  It has been
% decided that two workers whose scores sum more than maxScore cannot
% be in the same team.
%
% Additionally, we say that a team is complex iff it has two members
% whose sum of scores is at least a certain threshold. Our goal is to
% find a possible team distribution with the minimum number of complex
% teams.

numTeams(5). % exact number of teams needed
complexThreshold(12). % it means that any team with two members whose sum is >= 12
                      % is a complexTeam
